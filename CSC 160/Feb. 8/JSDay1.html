    // 1. Writing to the browser's console

    // 3. Writing to an alert box
        window.alert("Hello World!");

    //they will be interpreted as HTML by the browser.

    /*variable names are also known as identifiers. They should be short but descriptive.
    
    Rules for naming variables:
    1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollarsigns
    2. Names must begin with a letter
    3. Names can also begin with a $ and _
    4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are tow different variables)
    5. Reserved words (JS keywords) can not be used as names.

    //the = sign is the assignment operator
    //any statement with an = is an assignment statement
    //you can reassign a different value to a variable  you have already used.
