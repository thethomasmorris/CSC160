<h1>Making decisions in JavaScript</h1>
<h2>If and If/Else Statements</h2>
    
<script>
// If statements allow us to make decisions about what code to execute
// the basic if makes a single decision based on one condition
// if condition is true, the code in curly braces executes
// if condition is false, that code is skipped and nothing happens
    

var age = 11;

if (age>=16) {
    document.write("You can drive.<br>");
}
document.write("This is out of the if statement.<br>");

if (age<12) {
    document.write("You are in elementary school.<br>");
}

age = parseInt(prompt("Please enter your age: "));

// sometimes we want one thing to happen if condition is true and something else to happen if condition is false
    
if(age >= 18) {
    document.write("You are old enough to vote.<br>");
} else {
    document.write("You are not old enough to vote.<br>");
}

//comparison operators
// >, <, >=, <=, == (equal), != (not equal)
// you can also have compound criteria
// && (and), || (or) pipe symbols is shifted backslash

// and example
if (age>=16 && age<18) {
    document.write("You can drive, but you can not vote yet. <br>");
}
    
// or example - only one condition must be true to execture IF
var answer = prompt("Do you have your driver's license? Enter Y or N as your answer.");

if (answer == "y" || answer == "Y") {
    document.write("You are a licensed driver.<br>");
} else {
    document.write("You are not a licensed driver.<br>");
